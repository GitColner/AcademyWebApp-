🎓 AcademyWebApp
AcademyWebApp is a front-end web application designed for educational institutions. Built with modern HTML5 and CSS, it features a clean and informative layout suitable for schools, academies, or colleges.

>⚠️ This is a front-end only project. There is no backend or database integration yet.
🗂️ Apologies for the unorganized folder structure — it's structured this way to help avoid path issues when deploying on GitHub Pages.
💻 Note: This site is currently designed only for desktop screens. Responsive design for tablets and mobile devices will be added in future updates.
